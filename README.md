# Firestore Node.js Project

This is a blank Node.js project pre-configured to connect to Firestore. It can be used as a starting point for building a backend service with Firebase.

## Running the Project

1.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

    This will execute the `index.js` script, which demonstrates connecting to Firestore, adding some sample data, and then querying for it.
